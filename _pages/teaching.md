The following is a selection of courses I have had the pleasure of teaching. Additionally, I developed a graduate-level course titled **"Mobility Data Analytics: Understanding Movement from EVs to Wildlife Migration,"** designed for programs in Computer Science, Data Science, and related fields. While I have not yet taught this course, all the material is fully prepared. I am available to teach it at any institution where there is interest, and I can provide more details upon request to faculty or administrative staff.

##### **COSC 1047: Introduction to Computer Science II (Accelerated)**
**University Name:** Algoma University  
**Location:** Brampton, ON, Canada  
**Semester:** Winter 2024  
**Role:** Course Instructor

**Description:**  
I taught both the Lecture and Lab sessions. This course takes a software engineering approach to programming in the large with particular emphasis on modularity, abstract data types, program specification, testing, documentation and maintenance. Students will develop and document software with reusable software libraries. The focus is on Java programming language.

##### **MECHTRON 2MD3: Data Structures and Algorithms for Mechatronics**
**University Name:** McMaster University  
**Location:** Hamilton, ON, Canada  
**Semester:** Winter 2022  
**Role:** Course Instructor

**Description:**  
Advanced programming with emphasis on embedded systems. Program specifications: Pre- and post-conditions, loop and datatype invariants; use of tools to demonstrate correctness. Selecting data structures for implementation of mathematical abstractions. Finite state machines, automata and languages; lexing and parsing. Algorithm analysis (time and space). Modelling of graphs, relations, corresponding algorithms. I tailored the course material to incorporate the C++ programming language and selected a new textbook to better align with the course objectives set by the detpartment.
