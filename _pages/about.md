My research activity is mainly oriented towards mobility data analytics, focusing on big data and data-intensive techniques to manage and process massive amounts of trajectory data. I developed specific memory-based trajectory data analysis techniques using Apache Spark to process data in a distributed manner with indexing techniques based on reduced representations of trajectories.

Currently, I have two ongoing research topics based mainly on the historical data of individual users. First, I work on applications related to sustainable mobility, especially carpooling and electric vehicles, utilizing the individual mobility networks of users. Second, I work on event prediction techniques that try to make explainable decisions based on the user's history and current events.
